random forest classifier:
asking random questions to multiple ppl 
and trusting the majority for the prediction 

Truck delay prediction web portal
Predicts:
probability that a truck shipment will be delayed
 
based on:
weather conditions
truck details
driver details
route conditions 

it uses:
ml model(random forest)
extraction transformation and loading of data(etl pipeline)
the streamlit web app for deployment 

so to make smthing like this i need to follow steps:

step 1
understand the problem
What am I predicting?
Example: Will a truck be delayed? (Yes / No)

What type of ML problem?
Binary classification{0/1}

What inputs will I use?
Weather, truck info, driver info, route info

What output do I want?
Probability of delay (not just yes/no)

step 2
extraction process extract the data get all relevant data inside python

step 3
Handle missing values
Separate features & target
Separate numerical & categorical columns
Encode categorical data
Scale numerical data
Combine processed data

step 4
split data
train data using random forest 
import random forest 
evaluate modle

step 5
save the model and processes 
inorder to deploy

step 6
build a streamlit app for deployment
inside load saved files
take use inputs
processes use inputs
predict and show output

step 7 
run the app

step 8 
create requirements 
streamlit
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn

step 9 
use virtual environment(optional)

so basically:
Problem → Data → ETL → Model → Save → App → Predict
